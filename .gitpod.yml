#
# This '.gitpod.yml' file when placed at the root of a project instructs
# Gitpod how to prepare & build the project, start development environments
# and configure continuous prebuilds. Prebuilds when enabled builds a project
# like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for
# dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests
# or hacking on something new.
#
# With Gitpod you can develop software from any device (even iPads) via
# desktop or browser based versions of VS Code or any JetBrains IDE and
# customise it to your individual needs - from themes to extensions, you
# have full control.

tasks:
  - name: Initialize & Configure AWS
    command: bash $GITPOD_REPO_ROOT/configure_aws_with_gitpod.sh

# The 'github' section defines configuration of continuous prebuilds
# for GitHub repositories when the GitHub application
# 'https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io' is installed in GitHub and granted
# permissions to access the repository.
